## Computer Vision for Beginners

### What is Computer Vision?

**Computer Vision (CV)** is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It involves the development of algorithms and models to enable computers to "see" and make decisions based on visual data.

### Why Computer Vision?

**1) Automation:** CV allows machines to automate tasks that typically require human vision, such as image recognition, object detection, and facial recognition.

**2)Enhanced User Experience:** Applications like augmented reality and image processing enhance user experiences in various domains, from gaming to healthcare.

**3) Industry Applications:** CV finds applications in industries like healthcare (medical imaging), automotive (autonomous vehicles), and security (surveillance systems).

### Where is Computer Vision Used?

**1) Healthcare:** Diagnosis and medical image analysis.

**2) Retail:** Object recognition for inventory management.

**3) Autonomous Vehicles:** Visual perception for self-driving cars.

**4) Security:** Facial recognition and surveillance systems.

**5) Entertainment:** Augmented reality, virtual reality, and gaming.
